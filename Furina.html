        Furina de Fontaine is a playable Hydro character
          in Genshin Impact who can alternate between
          <b class="Pneuma">Pneuma</b> and <b class="Ousia">Ousia</b> alignments.
          Introduced as the flamboyant and overconfident
          Hydro Archon, Furina's theatrics are eventually
          revealed to be a public persona, which she later
          discards in favor of living a relatively humbler
          life as an actress and artistic consultant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite her dazzling presence, Furina's story is one of inner conflict
        and transformation — balancing the burden of divine duty with the
        fragile humanity beneath.
